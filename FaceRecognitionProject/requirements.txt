To successfully run the Net Banking project integrated with Face/Password Authentication, you need to meet several requirements and follow specific installation steps. Below is a detailed breakdown of the necessary components and their installation procedures.
Project Requirements

Software Requirements
Python: The primary programming language for backend development.
Flask: A lightweight web framework for Python.
OpenCV (cv2): A library for computer vision tasks.
face_recognition: A library for face detection and recognition.
NumPy: A library for numerical operations in Python.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For frontend development.
Hardware Requirements
Webcam: Required for capturing video input for face recognition.
Computer: A machine capable of running Python and the necessary libraries.
Installation Steps
Step 1: Install Python
Download the latest version of Python from the official website.
Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Ensure that you check the box to add Python to your PATH during installation.
Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Creating a virtual environment helps manage dependencies:
bash
# Install virtualenv if not already installed
pip install virtualenv

# Create a new virtual environment
virtualenv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

Step 3: Install Required Libraries
Use pip to install the necessary libraries:
bash
pip install Flask
pip install opencv-python
pip install face_recognition
pip install numpy

Step 4: Verify Installation
You can verify that the libraries are installed correctly by running:
python
import cv2
import face_recognition
import numpy as np
from flask import Flask

print("All libraries imported successfully!")

Step 5: Clone or Download the Project Repository
Clone the repository using Git or download it as a ZIP file from GitHub.
Step 6: Run the Application
Navigate to the project directory where your main.py file is located and run:
bash
python main.py

This will start the Flask server, typically accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
Conclusion
By following these steps, you can set up and run the Net Banking project with Face/Password Authentication effectively. Ensure that all software dependencies are installed correctly, and your hardware is ready for use, especially the webcam for face recognition functionalities.
